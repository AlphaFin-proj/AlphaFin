## Brief Introduction

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/case.png" width="50%"/>
<p>

We opensource our **AlphaFin** series, now including **AlphaFin dataset**, the chat models trained on AlphaFin, namely **StockGPT-Stage1** and **StockGPT-Stage2**, as well as **Stock-Chain**, the retrieval-augmented financial analysis framework.

We focus on two financial real-world tasks: **Stock Trend Prediction** and **Financial Q&A**. By integrating with RAG, we address the issue of hallucination of LLM’s output and LLM’s inability to generate real-time content.

- [AlphaFin](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlphaFin/AlphaFin-dataset-v1): contains traditional research datasets, real-time financial data, and handwritten CoT data, enhancing LLM’s ability in financial analysis.

- [StockGPT-Stage1](https://huggingface.co/AlphaFin/StockGPT-Stage1) is LLM fine-tuned with LoRA method on Fin. Reports and Fin. Reports CoT from AlphaFin, which is specialized for stock trend prediction task.

- [StockGPT-Stage2](https://huggingface.co/AlphaFin/StockGPT-Stage2) is continue trained with the research dataset, financial news, and StockQA datasets of AlphaFin, which is more conprehensive and capable of handling financial Q&A task.

## Quick Start

Preparation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaFin-proj/AlphaFin.git
cd AlphaFin
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Stage 1

Firstly, download [ChatGLM2-6B](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm2-6b) and [StockGPT-Stage1](https://huggingface.co/AlphaFin/StockGPT-Stage1) model checkpoints locally. Then, fill in your [tushare api token](https://tushare.pro/) and the local path of these ckpts in `scripts/stage1_trend_prediction.sh`. Finally, execute the following command to run the code

```bash
bash scripts/stage1_trend_prediction.sh
```

Stage 2

Firstly, download [ChatGLM2-6B](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm2-6b), [StockGPT-Stage2](https://huggingface.co/AlphaFin/StockGPT-Stage2), and [BGE-Large-zh](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-zh) model checkpoints locally. Then, specify the local path of these ckpts in `scripts/stage2_financial_qa.sh`. Finally, execute the following command to run the code

```bash
bash scripts/stage2_financial_qa.sh
```

For Stage 2, we provide 200 sample data of news, research report and stock price documents for you to try this project, and more document data will be opened in this project as soon as possible after it is sorted out.

## Dataset

<p>

Data source and preprocessing of the proposed AlphaFin datasets is shown in the figure. We ensure that our dataset covers a wide range of core financial analysis tasks, including NLI, financial QA, stock trend predictions, and so on. AlphaFin contains both Chinese and English datasets to eliminate potential linguistic biases. The English data primarily encompasses traditional financial and NLP-related tasks, while the Chinese data mainly contains financial research reports and stock predictions.

| Dataset | Size | Input Len.  | Output Len. | Lang. |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Research | 42K | 712.8 | 5.6 | en |
| StockQA | 21K | 1313.6 | 40.8 | zh |
| Fin. News | 79K | 497.8 | 64.2 | zh |
| Fin. Reports | 120K | 2203 | 17.2 | zh |
| Fin. Reports CoT | 200 | 2184.8 | 407.8 | zh |


## Performance

    <img src="assets/long-short-test.png" width="1000"/>
<p>

Our Stock-Chain achieves the highest AR and maintains an upward trend, starting from 2023. It indicates the effectiveness of Stock-Chain in investment. Stock-Chain achieves the highest 30.8% of ARR demonstrating its effectiveness.
